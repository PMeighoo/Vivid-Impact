# Vivid-Impact
## Description 
Vivid Impact is a website where community program developers (e.g. social services or health programs) can create complete, professional lookng program plans which they can use to communicate their plans to others in their organization (for approvals, feedback, etc.), potential partner organizations and funders. There is a need for this because most workers in the non-profit sector tasked to create program plans have not been formally taught how to do so. 
## User Stories
1.  As a community program developer I want one website I can go to that has everything I need to create a complete program plan so that I don't have to figure out what's included in a program plan and how to create one on my own.
2.  As a senior administrator of a community organization, I want to be able to easily access complete and professional program plans my staff create so that I can use them to effectively communicate with and attract partners and funders.
3.  As a funder of community programs (government agency or private corporation) I want to have complete, professional program plans to review so that I can make good decisions about allocating resources and be accountable to my organization.
